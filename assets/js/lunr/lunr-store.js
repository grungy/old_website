In this program the goal was to make rectangular shaped Infrared LED (IRLED) emitter hybrids. The hybrids consisted of a CMOS die called a Read-In-Integrated-Circuit (RIIC), and an IRLED emitter...","categories": [],

Opamps behave much better. No more 416MHz ringing. I also removed the feedback capacitor because I read that this causes instability...","categories": [],
